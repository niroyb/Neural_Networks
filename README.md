Neural Networks
===============

This repo contains two implementations of neural networks commonly used for machine learning algorithms used in the field of artificial intelligence.

The neural networks are:
------------------------
* Perceptron
* Back propagation learning in multilevel neural network

The second algorithm deduces the level of the neurons from the initial neuron topology.
Neurons can be be indexed by arbitary types.
